**Legend:**
- **Performance:** ✅ >10% better | ⚠️ within ±10% | ❌ >10% worse
- **Accuracy:** ✅ ρ≥0.95 | ⚠️ 0.8≤ρ<0.95 | ❌ ρ<0.8
- **Overlap:** ✅ ≥0.7 | ⚠️ 0.5-0.7 | ❌ <0.5
- **Shrinkage:** ✅ <1% inflated | ⚠️ 1-10% inflated | ❌ >10% inflated

**Abbreviations:**
- ρ = Pearson correlation, ρₛ = Spearman correlation
- log-Pval = correlations on -log₁₀(p) transformed values
- sf=per = per-comparison size factor estimation (matches PyDESeq2)

**Notes:**
- Correlation and overlap values shown as mean±std across perturbations
- crispyx lfcShrink uses `method='stats'` (Gaussian approximation) which is numerically stable and ~35× faster than `method='full'`.
- P-value overlap excludes lfcShrink methods since shrinkage only affects effect sizes, not p-values.
- **Warning:** PyDESeq2 may produce aberrant shrinkage when dispersion trend fitting fails. crispyx shrinkage is more robust.
