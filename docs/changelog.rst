Changelog
=========

Version 0.0.1
-------------

*Initial release.*

* Streaming QC and preprocessing (filter cells, perturbations, genes;
  normalize and log-transform without loading the full matrix)
* Pseudo-bulk aggregation: average log expression and pseudo-bulk count
  matrices
* Differential expression: t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, NB-GLM with apeGLM
  LFC shrinkage, multi-core support, and adaptive memory management
* Dimension reduction: memory-efficient PCA and KNN graph construction on
  backed data
* Scanpy-compatible API and plotting: ``cx.pp``, ``cx.pb``, ``cx.tl``,
  ``cx.pl`` namespaces; rank genes plots, volcano, MA, PCA, UMAP, QC
  summaries, and overlap heatmaps
* Data preparation utilities: edit backed metadata, standardise gene names,
  normalise perturbation labels, auto-detect metadata columns
* HPC support: resume/checkpoint for long-running jobs, configurable
  ``memory_limit_gb``, Docker and Singularity support
* Benchmarking suite across 12 CRISPR screen datasets
