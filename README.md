## Motivation

Genome-wide CRISPR screens routinely produce datasets with hundreds of thousands of cells and tens of thousands of genes. Standard single-cell analysis toolkits (Scanpy, Pertpy) load the entire count matrix into memory, requiring large RAM allocations and often making routine workflows impractical on laptops or shared compute nodes.

**crispyx** solves this by streaming data directly from on-disk AnnData (`.h5ad`) files. Quality control, normalisation, pseudo-bulk aggregation, and differential expression all operate without materialising the full matrix.

## Features

- **Streaming QC & preprocessing** – Filter cells, perturbations, and genes; normalise and log-transform; select highly variable genes (`seurat_v3`/`mean_dispersion`, control-cells-only by default); CSC-aware streaming with `format_mismatch_policy`; all without loading the full matrix into memory
- **Subsampling & downsampling** – Stratified or cluster-sampled cell subsampling (`cx.pp.subsample`, exact count or proportion per stratum, drop or keep small groups) and dependency-free per-cell count thinning (`cx.pp.downsample_counts`, the streaming equivalent of `scanpy.pp.downsample_counts`) for aligning dataset scale and sequencing depth before comparing screens
- **Pseudo-bulk aggregation** – Absolute profiles over multiple grouping columns (for example, perturbation × batch), strict count sums or mean log1p expression, optional deterministic bootstrap sampling, and explicit within-batch effect calculation
- **Differential expression** – t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum (including batch-stratified / van Elteren test via `batch_column`), and negative binomial GLM with apeGLM LFC shrinkage; multi-core support and adaptive memory management; per-condition low-expression filtering to exclude genes that are near-zero in both groups
- **Dimension reduction** – Memory-efficient PCA and KNN graph construction on backed data
- **Scanpy-compatible API & plotting** – Familiar `cx.pp`, `cx.pb`, `cx.tl`, and `cx.pl` namespaces; Scanpy-style rank genes plots, volcano, MA, PCA, UMAP, QC summaries, and overlap heatmaps
- **Data preparation utilities** – Edit backed metadata without loading X; standardise gene names; normalise perturbation labels; auto-detect metadata columns
- **HPC-ready** – Resume/checkpoint for long-running jobs; configurable `memory_limit_gb`
- **Disk-aware** – Estimates and warns about scratch-disk usage before large writes or CSC/CSR conversions, and `cx.estimate_disk_usage(...)` answers "how much disk will this need?" up front; the memory savings above assume the machine has enough free disk for streaming intermediates and output files

## Quick Start

```python
import crispyx as cx

# Open dataset without loading into memory
adata = cx.read_h5ad_ondisk("data/demo_benchmark.h5ad")

# Quality control with adaptive thresholds
adata = cx.pp.qc_summary(
    adata,
    perturbation_column="perturbation",
    min_genes=5,
    min_cells_per_perturbation=5,
)

# Differential expression
adata = cx.tl.rank_genes_groups(
    adata,
    perturbation_column="perturbation",
    method="wilcoxon",  # or "t-test", "nb_glm"
)

# Access results
print(adata.uns["rank_genes_groups"])
de_results = adata.uns["rank_genes_groups"].load()
```

For the full workflow (normalisation, PCA, pseudo-bulk, NB-GLM, LFC shrinkage, plotting, data preparation utilities), see the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.rst) and the [tutorial notebook](docs/notebooks/crispyx_tutorial.ipynb).

## Performance

crispyx consistently outperforms Scanpy, Pertpy/PyDESeq2, and edgeR in both speed and memory across a range of CRISPR screen dataset sizes, with results matching Scanpy to Pearson *r* > 0.999:

## Installation

```bash
pip install crispyx
```

For development (editable install with all extras):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinhongdu-lab/crispyx.git
cd crispyx
pip install -e ".[test,benchmark,docs]"
```

crispyx supports Python 3.10–3.12 and is compatible with recent releases of the
scientific stack, including `anndata >= 0.13` and `pandas >= 3.0` (where string
metadata is stored on disk using the nullable-string encoding).

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

## Documentation

```bash
sphinx-build docs docs/_build
```
